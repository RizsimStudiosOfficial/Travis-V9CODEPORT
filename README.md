# Incredibox (0.7.0 MODDABLE)
I made this because why not and to keep track of the updates on the code if V9 B3 Update comes out this repo will be automatically updated to it
why did I make idk cuz why not

# IMPORTANT NOTE!
this repo is meant for modders and NOT for people playing the paid version for free AT ALL so if you want to play the OG game please buy it on https://www.incredibox.com
or play the demo instead: https://www.incredibox.com/demo


# FOR MODDERS
i will add a modding branch to this soon lol just wait (but if you want to help me do it add me on discord rizsimstudiosvillagers)


# WHATS ADDED AND CHANGED
- added V9 B2
- changed the script min js to have all version completely moddable meaning all base version have been rewritten to be modifed by anyone
- changed V6 B3 combo from code: "3,8,12,11,20" to code: "3,8,11,12,20" due to the incredibox devs not really fixing it
  
  and thats it really for now
